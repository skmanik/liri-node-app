`node liri.js my-tweets` which returns the last twenty tweets of a dummy twitter.

`node liri.js spotify-this-song EXAMPLE` which, provided you replace EXAMPLE with a valid song title, returns a Spotify track with information on the artist, album, etc.

`node liri.js movie-this EXAMPLE` which, provided you replace EXAMPLE with a valid movie title, returns information about that movie (release date, rating, plot, etc).

`node liri.js do-what-this-says` which runs whatever command is written in the `random.txt` file.
